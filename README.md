# TML's Undertale Engine - Complex Cheetos's Edition
Ninjaguardian's modified version of the heavily modified TML engine by Panthervention for GameMaker 2024.13+

Panthervention's engine edition features blue soul related functionalities, and mostly Sans related assets for battle (bone, blaster, platform, kr) with a small demo.

This engine expands on that by adding more ways to interact with the battle box, and it changes some design related elements. You can also show the HP above the soul by changing `obj_battle_soul.hp_above`!

# How do I import?
- For project setup, you should download and load the .yyz file so you can also import engine's proper settings like Texture Groups and some project behaviors.
- For updates, you can download the .yymps instead and import the assets directly from there, so you don't have to start over again when the update comes.
